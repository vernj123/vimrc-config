# My vimrc config and basic vim use how-to

This is mostly for backing up my vimrc while learning and practicing on how to use git on the terminal including
pushing to a repo.
With that should anyone discover this vimrc feel free to use it as well as referencing the general vim use notes
within this README.
Cheers

Plug 'lokaltog/powerline-fontpatcher'

Adding the above plug for reference. 
That plug was used when trying to activate powerline symbols however after
adding let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1 combined with the previous 
hack nerd and powerline fonts the symbols now work.
I deleted this from my plugins and vimrc and everything still works.
